# CSC380
Concordia Deep Learning Course

This is a reporsitory for the CSC 380 Final Project

The project will be broken down into several parts:
1. Data Collection (individual or small groups) - To build an image classification model, we will need images (lots of images). Some of these images should include Niblet, some should not.
  a. Each person is responsible for collecting 100 images to contribute to the dataset.
  b. You may collaborate with a small group (a group of three would be expected to collect 300 images).
  c. Images should be in a compatible format for OpenCV (preferably JPEG). For iPhone users, here is a link to how to take images in JPEG format.
  d. Niblet should be in approximately half of the images.
  e. Store all images of Niblet in one folder; store all images without Niblet in a separate folder.
  f. Niblet can be checked out from Dr. Tanner’s office ISC 364 (Dr. Anderson’s old office) for short periods of time. There is a sign out sheet. Please write down your name and when you expect to return Niblet. If you have your own Niblet, you may use it.
  g. Due Tuesday April 16 by class time (bring to class).
2. Image Processing and Augmentation (class activity) - Tuesday April 16
3. Model from Scratch (build as a class, tweak individually) - Thursday April 18
4. Transfer Learning Model (build as a class, tweak individually) - Tuesday April 23
5. Model Assessment - Final Exam Period - Wednesday May 1
  a. Dr. Tanner will provide a test set of images (some will contain Niblet, some won’t)
  b. We will assess each of your models.
  c. Prizes: Best Model Performance, Best Image of Niblet, Best Meme with Niblet
